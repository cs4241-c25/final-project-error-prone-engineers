4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.

For our project, each person in our team tried something new. Everyone in our team had a good amount of experience with web application development, either from CS 3733 Software Engineering, summer internships, or personal projects. One way that we challenged ourselves was choosing to use Next and React rather than React and Express. It was difficult at first to understand the difference between client and server files in the Next framework, but once we understood more about how to use Next, it became much easier for us to write our application code. We ended up appreciating some of the cool things built into Next, such as routing from folders.

Another challenge we faced was with procrastination. With each of our busy schedules, it was difficult to find times to meet as a team. Without meeting all the time, it was sometimes difficult for everyone to stay on top of their tasking. However, with clear communication through our Discord group chat, we were able to work with each other to make sure that we were accomplishing our goals.

5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.

* **William Gilmore** - Displayed location nodes on the map along with their corresponding information pop-ups.
* **Adrian Johnson** - Made Figma mockups for various pages, created account (login, register, and profile) pages.
* **Andrew Mesa** - Got authentication working with both Google OAuth and local encryption/database, got location nodes and badges from the database.
* **Keira Schoolcraft** - Created the map, added live location tracking functionality, styled various sections of the application, tested our application on the Freedom Trail, wrote location descriptions and took pictures of sites.
* **Katy Stuparu** - Created the frontend forms, backend routes, and database schema for creating, editing, deleting, and viewing business accounts and their corresponding location nodes, including using an address to location geocoding API.
